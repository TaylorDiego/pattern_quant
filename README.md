A simple algorithm to find pattern in images

Pattern can be simply defined as a collection of three or more similar items, actions, or ideas. From a previous project, I have been trying to imagine a simple way to summarize patterns in images. I hope to do so here.

I will attempt this project in several pieces.
• find the most represented colors using Lab colorspace
  - determine relative variability of color in the image
